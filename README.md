#### This is a Crowdfunding app that ultimately shows the great eager to master web3.0  and a lot about smart contracts.. It shows the fll functions for supporting different campaigns and projects - With ETH..

### Need to install these dependencies to follow along with its full functionalities ::

<i>Run these tasks to setup dev environment with thirdweb</i>

#### Blockend
```
npx thirdweb@latest create --contract
npm install dotenv
```
Try running these task to deploy your contract ::
 ```
 npm run deploy
 ```
When the deploy is done, you'll get a url in the terminal which you'll then click to deploy your contract on thirdweb 

#### Note:: Mind to use Goerli test network to get faucet b'coz it's the most stable.

#### Frontend
```
npx thirdweb create --app
npm install react-router-dom
npm run dev

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
